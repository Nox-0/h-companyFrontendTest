Hello, this is Danila Bublik's Frontend Developer Test for [h-company] NZ

There are probably a few ways to run this app but I only know how to do it with Expo.

1) If you don't have expo installed, install expo by running `npm install -g expo-cli` (make sure you can run scripts, may need to contact sysadmin)
2) Change directory to `\halterComeOnePlease\` (sorry about the name lol)
3) Run `npm install`
4) Enter `npm start` in your terminal
5) For android devices: install the Expo app (google play store) and either connect your phone to your computer via USB or scan the QR code that will be generated. For iOS devices, I think you can just scan the QR code. For all else, click the web option or instead click `w` in the terminal

React Native was pretty new to me (I'm pretty good with Vue) but I managed to deliver a(n) MVP :)

Thanks!
Danila
